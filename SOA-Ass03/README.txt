=====================================================================================

- navigation: each directory is a link to its content(list of elements).

- if the client want to show the content (as rss) he will press show.

- now, we assumed that if the client want's to watch some feed content,
then, if he will press showing some non-valid feed content, the result of the previous
call (the content of the valid feed) will remain in the results display.
that is because we think the client will prefer to stay with the valid request
result than staying with no results at all.
